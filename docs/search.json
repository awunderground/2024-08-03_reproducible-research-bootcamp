    "text": "Preface\nA reproducible research workflow should generate the same results from the same inputs every time. Unfortunately, software changes, key documentation is skipped, and that hard drive from graduate school disappeared during that last move. Reproducible research should be a minimum expectation of computational science, but too many researchers lack the tools to embrace a fully reproducible workflow. This full-day course aims to equip researchers with fundamental tools for reproducible research. The course will introduce Quarto, Git and GitHub, coding best practices, and environment management with renv through hands-on exercises and clear resources. Attendees will leave equipped to weather constantly changing software versions, documentation will be too fun to skip, and even a missing hard drive won’t ruin years of work. The course focuses on R but the content is broadly applicable.",

    "text": "3.1 1. Code First\nSource: Qr189\nThe Great British Bake Off (GBBO) is a popular show about a baking competition in Great Britain. Each week contestants compete in a three-round baking competition. The second round is always the technical challenge, where bakers try to finish a challenging bake with intentionally vague instructions. Data analysis should never feel like a technical round from the GBBO.\nOur analyses should be captured from start to finish by a script or scripts. If we think of a script as a recipe, we want to capture every step from buying the ingredients for a bake all the way to how we put the bake on the table. Ideally, we want to capture every step with code.\nThis desire should influence our tool selection. Point-and-click tools like Excel, Tableau, and Power BI are widely used but fall short of this simple standard. Instead, we should use programming languages with robust functionality.\nHow we use these programming languages matters! R and Python are powerful because they support interactive data analysis that works well with the development and testing of hypotheses. The uncleaned results of interactive data analysis are rarely reproducible. Rather, we need to clean up our scripts so they run from start to finish without intervention (executable) and achieve all of the objectives of our final analysis.\nProprietary tools like SAS and Stata can be used for reproducible workflows! I have a personal preference for R, Python, and Julia because they are open source and promote accessibility because they don’t cost any money for users. R and Python used to be much tougher to use. Now they are supported by Integrated Development Environments (IDE) like RStudio, Positron, and VS Code.\nAdopting a code-first approach to data analysis creates many benefits!\nWe’ll cover more programming concepts later. For now, let’s focus on three.\nif (!file.exists(\"data/data.csv\")) {\n\n  download.file(url = \"web-url.csv\", destfile = \"data/data.csv\")\n\n}\nDuring development, it’s easy to run lines of code out of order or to skip capturing an important step like loading a package or dropping that pesky outlier. Restarting your computing environment early and often can promote good practices and ensure accountability. This is easy in RStudio using Session &gt; Restart R.",

Any result can be mapped back to the code and data that created the result.\nCode allows for robust version control.\nCode can scale analyses to bigger data and bigger projects.\n\n\n\nLoad external dependencies at the top of an analysis.\nWhen possible, gather your data using code. Many data sets can be accessed through application programming interface (API). For example, if you run a data collection using Qualtrics use the Qualtrics API instead of point-and-clicking to download the data from the website. With R, it’s possible to download data with download.file(). I don’t recommend downloading the data every time you run your analysis. Instead, download the data only if the data aren’t present.\n\n\n\nFinally, capture outputs with code. It’s so tempting to jump into a tool like Excel but this undermines our objectives. library(ggplot2) is powerful for data visualizations and library(gt) is powerful for tables.",

    "text": "3.2 2. Project-Oriented Workflow\nWe will use a project-oriented workflow.\n\n3.2.1 R Projects\nR Projects, proper noun, are the best way to organize an analysis. They have several advantages:\n\nThey make it possible to concurrently run multiple RStudio sessions.\nThey allow for project-specific RStudio settings.\nThey integrate well with Git version control.\nThey are the “node” of relative file paths. (more on this in a second) This makes code highly portable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nBefore setting up an R Project, go to Tools &gt; Global Options and uncheck “Restore most recently opened project at startup”.\n\n\nEvery new analysis in R should start with an R Project. First, create a directory that holds all data, scripts, and files for the analysis. You can do this right in RStudio by clicking the “New Folder” button at the top of the “Files” tab located in the top or bottom right of RStudio. Storing files and data in a sub-directories is encouraged. For example, data can be stored in a folder called data/.\nNext, click “New Project…” in the top right corner.\n\nWhen prompted, turn your recently created “Existing Directory” into a project.\n\nUpon completion, the name of the R Project should now be displayed in the top right corner of RStudio where it previously displayed “Project: (None)”. Once opened, .RProj files do not need to be saved. Double-clicking .Rproj files in the directory is now the best way to open RStudio. This will allow for the concurrent use of multiple R sessions and ensure the portability of file paths. Once an RStudio project is open, scripts can be opened by double-clicking individual files in the computer directory or clicking files in the “Files” tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\nLet’s walk through this process and create an R project for this training.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Filepaths\nWindows file paths are usually delimited with \\. *nix file paths are usually delimited with /. Never use \\ in file paths in R. \\ is an escape character in R and will complicate an analysis. Fortunately, RStudio understands / in file paths regardless of operating system.\nNever use setwd() in R. It is unnecessary, it makes code unreproducible across machines, and it is rude to collaborators. R Projects create a better framework for file paths. Simply treat the directory where the R Project lives as the working directory and directories inside of that directory as sub-directories.\nFor example, say there’s a .Rproj called starwars-analysis.Rproj in a directory called starwars-analysis/. If there is a .csv in that folder called jedi.csv, the file can be loaded with read_csv(\"jedi.csv\") instead of read_csv(\"H:/alena/analyses/starwars-analysis/jedi.csv\"). If that file is in a sub-directory of starwars-analysis called data, it can be loaded with read_csv(\"data/jedi.csv\"). The same concepts hold for writing data and graphics.\nThis simplifies code and makes it portable because all relative file paths will be identical on all computers. To share an analysis, simply send the entire directory to a collaborator or share it with GitHub.\nHere’s an example directory:",

Documentation is essential to helping humans quickly and clearly understand the structure and steps of an analysis.\nNext, we’ll discuss commenting and READMEs.\n\n3.3.1 Comments\nComments are important for adding in-the-weeds context for code. R will interpret all text in a .R script as R code unless the code follows #, the comment symbol. Comments are essential to writing clear code in any programming language.\n\n# Demonstrate the value of a comment and make a simple calculation\n2 + 2\n\nIt should be obvious what a line of clear R code accomplishes. It isn’t always obvious why a clear line of R code is included in a script. Comments should focus on the why of R code and not the what of R code.\nThe following comment isn’t useful because it just restates the R code, which is clear:\n\n# divide every value by 1.11\ncost / 1.11\n\nThe following comment is useful because it adds context to the R code:\n\n# convert costs from dollars to Euros using the 2020-01-13 exchange rate\ncost / 1.11\n\nThe following is useful because it avoids magic numbers.\n\n# dollars to Euros 2020-01-13 exchange rate\nexchange_rate &lt;- 1.11\n\n# convert costs from dollars to Euros\ncost / exchange_rate\n\n\n\n3.3.2 README\nREADME’s are useful for providing big-picture context and instructions for a project. We will always include READMEs as a README.md file in the top level of our project directory. File ending in .md are Markdown files.\nREADMEs should contain big-picture documentation for a project. Sections can include:\n\nBrief project description\nInstructions for contributions\nCodes of conduct\nInstructions for reproduction\nLicenses\nExamples\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nBoosting Upward Mobility from Poverty\nCode and results for ‘The Association between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001-2014’\nStyle Guide for ‘The Association between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001-2014’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe should now have a project directory with a .Rproj and a README.",

    "text": "4.2 Quarto\nQuarto is a literate statistical programming tool for R, Julia, Python, JavaScript, and more that was released by Posit in 2022. Quarto is an important tool for reproducible research. It combines narrative text with styles, code, and the output of code and can be used to create many types of documents including PDFs, html websites, slides, and more.\nQuarto builds on the success of R Markdown. In fact, Quarto will Render R Markdown (.Rmd) documents without any edits or changes.\nJupyter (Julia, Python, and R) is a competing framework that is popular for Python but has not caught on for R.\nAccording to Wickham and Grolemund (2016) Chapter 27, there are three main reasons to use R Markdown (they hold for Quarto) :\n\n\n“For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.”\n“For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code).”\n“As an environment in which to do data science, as a modern day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.”\n\n\nQuarto uses\n\nplain text files ending in .qmd that are similar to .R files.\nlibrary(knitr).\npandoc.1\n\nQuarto calls library(knitr) and “knits” .qmd (Quarto files) into .md (Markdown files), which Pandoc then converts into any specified output type. Quarto and library(knitr) don’t need to be explicitly loaded, and the entire process is handled by clicking the “Render” button in RStudio.\n\nSource: Quarto website\nClicking the “Render” button starts this process.\n\nQuarto, library(knitr), and Pandoc are all installed with RStudio.2\nThe “Render” workflow has a few advantages:\n\nAll code is rerun in a clean environment when “Rendering”. This ensures that the code runs in order and is reproducible.\nIt is easier to document code than with inline comments.\nThe output types are really appealing. By creating publishable documents with code, there is no need to copy-and-paste or transpose results.\nThe process is iterable and scalable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\n\nClick the new script button and add a “Quarto Document”.\nGive the document a name, an author, and ensure that HTML is selected.\nSave the document as “hello-quarto.qmd”.\nClick “Render”.",

YAML header\nYAML stands for “yet another markup language.” The YAML header contains meta information about the document including output type, document settings, and parameters that can be passed to the document. The YAML header starts with --- and ends with ---.\nHere is the simplest YAML header for a PDF document:\n---\nformat: html\n---\nYAML headers can contain many output specific settings. This YAML header creates an HTML document with code folding and a floating table of contents:\n---\nformat: \n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n    toc: true\n---  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\n\nAdd embed-sources: true to your YAML header.\nUpdate the html line to look like:\n\n---\nembed-resources: true\nformat: \n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n---  \n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 2.

Code chunks\n\nMore frequently, code is added in code chunks:\n\n```{r}\n2 + 2\n```\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nThe first argument inline or in a code chunk is the language engine. Most commonly, this will just be a lower case r. knitr allows for many different language engines:\n\nR\nJulia\nPython\nSQL\nBash\nRcpp\nStan\nJavascript\nCSS\n\nQuarto has a rich set of options that go inside of the chunks and control the behavior of Quarto.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n\n2 + 2\n```\n\nIn this case, eval makes the code not run. Other chunk-specific settings can be added inside the brackets. Here3 are the most important options:\n\n\n\nOption\nEffect\n\n\n\n\necho: false\nHides code in output\n\n\neval: false\nTurns off evaluation\n\n\noutput: false\nHides code output\n\n\nwarning: false\nTurns off warnings\n\n\nmessage: false\nTurns off messages\n\n\nfig-height: 8\nChanges figure width in inches4\n\n\nfig-width: 8\nChanges figure height in inches5\n\n\n\nDefault settings for the entire document can be changed in the YAML header with the execute option:\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\n\n\n\n\nAdd a code chunk.\nLoad the storms data set.\nFilter the data to only include hurricanes.\nMake a data visualization with ggplot2 using the data from\nInclude an option to hide the R code.\nRender!",

This YAML header creates an HTML document with code folding and a floating table of contents:\n---\nformat: \n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\n    code-fold: true\n    toc: true\n---  \nOne key specification in the YAML header are parameters or params. Here is an example:\n---\nformat: html\nparams:\n  state: \"Virginia\"\n---\nNow state can be referred to anywhere in R code as params$state.\nParameters are useful for a couple of reasons:\n\nWe can clearly change key values for a Quarto document in the YAML header. This could be a useful place to define constants and avoid magic numbers.\nWe can create a template and programmatically iterate the template over a set of values with the quarto_render() function and library(purrr).

If we don’t include embed-resources: true, then we will need to share image.png and example.html to see the embedded image. This is also true for other files like .css which is useful to provide custom styling for websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\n\nIn the hello-quarto.qmd file you previously created, add date: today to your YAML header after title.

For example, \\alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) and \\beta (\\(\\beta\\)).\n\n\n\nTable 5.4: My Caption\n\n\n\n\n\nLaTeX\nSymbol\n\n\n\n\n\\alpha\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\n\n\\beta\n\\(\\beta\\)\n\n\n\\gamma\n\\(\\gamma\\)\n\n\n\\Delta\n\\(\\Delta\\)\n\n\n\\epsilon\n\\(\\epsilon\\)\n\n\n\\theta\n\\(\\theta\\)\n\n\n\\pi\n\\(\\pi\\)\n\n\n\\sigma\n\\(\\sigma\\)\n\n\n\\chi\n\\(\\chi\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMath mode also recognizes \\(\\log(x)\\) (\\log(x)) and \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) (\\sqrt{x}).\nSuperscripts (^) are important for exponentiation and subscripts (_) are important for adding indices. y = x ^ 2 renders as \\(y = x ^ 2\\) and x_1, x_2, x_3 renders as \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\). Brackets are useful for multi-character superscripts and subscripts like \\(s_{11}\\) (s_{11}).\nIt is useful to add symbols to letters. For example, \\bar{x} is useful for sample means (\\(\\bar{x}\\)), \\hat{y} is useful for predicted values (\\(\\hat{y}\\)), and \\vec{\\beta} is useful for vectors of coefficients (\\(\\vec{\\beta}\\)).\nMath mode supports fractions with \\frac{x}{y} (\\(\\frac{x}{y}\\)), big parentheses with \\left(\\right) (\\(\\left(\\right)\\)), and brackets with \\left[\\right] (\\(\\left[\\right]\\)).\nMath mode has a symbol for summation. Let’s combine it with bars, fractions, subscripts, and superscipts to show sample mean \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_i^n x_i, which looks like \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_i^n x_i\\).\n\\sim is how to add the tilde for distributed as. For example, X \\sim N(\\mu = 0, \\sigma = 1) shows the normal distribution \\(X \\sim N(\\mu = 0, \\sigma = 1)\\).\nMatrices are are a little bit more work in math mode. Consider the follow variance-covariance matrix:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ns_{11}^2 & s_{12}\\\\\ns_{21} & s_{22}^2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ns_{11}^2 & s_{12}\\\\\ns_{21} & s_{22}^2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis guide provides and exhaustive look at math options in Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMath mode is finicky! Small errors like mismatched parentheses or superscript and subscript errors will cause Quarto documents to fail to render. Write math carefully and render early and often.",

    "text": "6.6 Git + GitHub Workflow\nRepository: A collection of files, often a directory, where files are organized and logged by Git.\nGit and GitHub organize projects into repositories. Typically, a “repo” will correspond with the place where you started a .Rproj. When working with Git and GitHub, your files will exist in two places: locally on your computer and remotely on GitHub.\nWhen creating a new repository, you can use either of the following alternatives:\n\nInitialize the repo locally on your computer and later add the repo to GitHub\nInitialize the repo remotely on GitHub and then copy (clone) the repo to your computer.\n\nTo create a repository (only needs to be done once per project):\ngit init initializes a local Git repository.\nOR\ngit clone &lt;link&gt; copies a remote repository from GitHub to the location of the working directory on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\n\n\n\nWe’re going to create a repo remotely on GitHub and clone it to our computer.\n\nGo to GitHub.\nClick the big green “New” button.\nCall the repo first-repo. Select a public repository and check the box that says Add a README file.\nClick the “Create Repository” button.\nClick the green “Code” button and copy the SSH link.\nNavigate to your cli-exercise folder on the command line using cd. Run git clone &lt; link &gt;, where you replace &lt; link &gt; with the SSH link you copied. This will create a folder called first-repo with your repo files, including the README.md file you created when you initialized the repo.\n\nSee Section 6.11 for the instructions on initializing a repo locally and then adding to GitHub.\n\n\n\n6.6.1 Basic Approach\n\nInitialize a repository for a project (we’ve already done this!).\nTell Git which files to track. Track scripts. Avoid tracking data or binary files like .xlsx. 1\nTake a snapshot of tracked files and add a commit message.\nSave the tracked files to the remote GitHub repository.\nRepeat, repeat, repeat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.2 Commands\ngit status prints out all of the important information about your repo. Use it before and after most commands to understand how code changes your repo.\ngit add &lt;file-name&gt; adds a file to staging. It says, “hey look at this!”.\ngit commit -m \"&lt;message&gt;\" commits changes made to added files to the repository. It says, “hey, take a snapshot of the things you looked at in the previous command.” Don’t forget the -m. 2\ngit push origin main pushes your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub. It says, “hey, take a look at these snapshots I just made”. It is possible to push to branches other than main.

Select the option to associate the R project with an existing directory and select the first-repo directory. This will open the first-repo project.\nCreate a quarto document.

Edit the YML header of the document to set self-contained to true as follows:\n\nformat: \n      html:\n        self-contained: true\n\nIn a code chunk, add library(tidyverse) and create any graph with library(ggplot2) and the storms dataset.\nRender the document to html.\nIn the terminal, run git add index.qmd index.html. Then run git status.\nThen run git commit -m \"add first graph\" to commit the two files with a commit message. Then run git status again and observe the change.\nFinally, run git push origin main to push the commit to GitHub. Navigate to the repo on GitHub to confirm that the files have been pushed to your remote repo.\nMake some changes to your the graph in your index.qmd file (e.g. change the color of a geometry, add labels, etc.). Then run steps 5-8 again (with a different commit message in step 7).\nIn the GitHub repo, click on index.qmd then click on the History icon in the top right corner. Note that you’ll see your two commits. Click on the most recent commit and notice that you can see the changes that you’ve made to the file.",

    "text": "7.1.1 GitHub issues\nGitHub issues are a GitHub project management tool for managing to-dos and conversations about a code base. This feature of Github can be seen as a built-in alternative to project management softwares like Jira, Trello, and monday, among many others.\n\nFor each substantial change to the code base, open a GitHub issue.\n\n\n7.1.2 Working with Branches\n\nBranching Motivation\nThe track changes feature in programs like with Microsoft Word follows each and every keystroke or click. In the previous chapter, we compared git to a super-charged version of track changes, and we think this comparison is fair. However, code is different than prose. If a program is not working, it isn’t desirable to document and share a change until that change creates a different, but still working, program. Working with other developers can complicate this desire to always commit sensible changes.\nMeet branching. Branching allows multiple versions of the same program to be developed simultaneously and then merged together when those versions are ready and operational.\n\n\nBranching Diagrammed\nRecall the following diagram from last chapter. We need a way to:\n\nCreate branches\nSwitch between branches\nCombine branches\n\n\n\n\nA standard git workflow\n\n\nA second stylized (and cute!) example of this workflow can be seen in this tweet from Jennifer Gilbert. The octopus on the left side of the image represents an existing, operational piece of code. Two programmers create separate copies (branches) of that code, work to create independent features (represented by the heart glasses and a cowboy hat), and then merge those features back to the master branch when those features are operational.\n\n\nHow to branch\ngit branch prints out important information about the available branches in a repo. It is similar to git status in that it provides useful information while not making any changes.\ngit switch -c &lt;new branch name&gt; creates a new branch and then navigates you to the new branch.\ngit switch &lt;new branch name&gt; navigates you from your current branch to the specified branch. It is only possible to switch between branches if there are no uncommitted changes. 1\n\nUse git switch main to navigate to the main branch. Use git pull origin main to update your local version of the main branch with any remote changes.\nUse git switch -c &lt;new branch name&gt; to create and switch to a new branch with the name iss&lt;number&gt;, where  is the issue number from GitHub.\nWork as if you are on the main branch but push to branch iss&lt;number&gt;.\n\nJenny Bryan provides a more thorough background.\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Pull requests\nThe easiest way to merge branches is on GitHub with pull requests. When you are ready to merge the code, push all of your code to your remote branch.\n\nOn GitHub, click the new pull request button.\n\n\n\n\nAn New Pull Request\n\n\n\nThen set a pull request from the branch on the right to the branch on the left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the pull requests page and review the pull request.  \nMerge the pull request:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.4 Putting it all together\n\nOpen a GitHub issue for a substantial change to the project\nCreate a new branch named after the GitHub issue number\nAfter one or more commits, create a pull request and merge the code\n\n\n\n7.1.5 Merge conflicts\nIf you run into merge conflicts, either follow the GitHub instructions or follow Jenny Bryan’s instructions for resolving the conflict at the command line. Do not panic!",

A basic setup is to use index.html or README.md as an index to connect individual pages together whose URLs are based on their file names.\nLet’s walk through an example:\n\n7.2.1 README as homepage\n\nCreate a new local directory with a README.md.\nRun echo \"&lt;h1&gt;Page 1&lt;\\h1&gt;\" &gt; page1.html at the command line.\ngit init, git add, and git commit your changes.\nCreate a remote repository on GitHub and link it to your local repository.\nPush your local changes.\nNavigate to Settings in your GitHub repo. Go to GitHub pages and set the source to “main branch”. The page will reload and a link will appear. Go to the link.\nAdd page1 to the end of the link\nAdd the link to page1 in the README. git add, git commit, and git push.\n\n\n\n7.2.2 index as homepage\nThe Urban Institute R Users Group website does not use the README as a home page. Instead it uses and index page.\n\nRun echo \"&lt;h1&gt;Index&lt;\\h1&gt;\" &gt; index.html at the command line.\nRun echo \"&lt;a href=\"https://awunderground.github.io/git-example/page1\"&gt;Page 1&lt;/a&gt;\" &gt; index.html at the command line where url is the link to Page 1 on GitHub pages.\nAdd, commit, and push your code to the main branch.\nAfter a few minutes return to the link provided on GitHub pages.",
