## Questions for You

* What types of analyses do you develop?
* What is your programming experience?
* What are you most interested to learn?

## Outline

**Process**

* Please ask questions at any time.
* I need to know how you are doing. Please ask lots of questions and give your reactions.
* I will check in during breaks about pacing and content.

**Goals**

* Enthusiasm
* Develop a firm foundation with tools for reproducible research
* Leave with enough understanding and resources that you can apply the covered material to your own work
    * You will still need to look stuff up!
    * I will try to give you hints for where to find help
